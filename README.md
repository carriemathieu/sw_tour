# SwTour

May the force be with you! This Ruby Gem uses the Star Wars API to travel through the Star Wars universe! You can choose your own spaceship and planet, while finding out fun facts about both.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sw_tour'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sw_tour

## Usage

Run the program by ./bin/sw_tour in your terminal, and follow the prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
